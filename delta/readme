In order to serve delta bundles in JIT fashion for production mode devices "delta.php" may be used on an appropriatly configured apache/php enabled server.

USAGE: Usage: http://developer.avego.com/bundles/delta.php?os=(ios|android)&src=<source bundle timestamp>&tgt=<target bundle timestamp>

This script assumes that it resides in a "bundles" directory where all bundled builds of our application are published in the form:
.
├── 1380823513
│   ├── android
│   │   └── carma-splinter.zip
│   └── ios
│       └── carma-splinter.zip
.
.
.
└── delta.php

The numerical directory name is the timestamp UTC seconds of when the bundle was created and deployed. 
These directories are created as a result of our build server bundle task. (currently: http://192.168.155.32:8080/job/bundle-carma-splinter-dynamic/)

This script assumes that bundles are named "carma-splinter.zip"

Given 2 valid bundles (as deemed by the existence of a timestamped directory), the script will go on to determine if a delta bundle between the source 
and the target bundles already exists and serve that delta bundle if it does.  If not it will create a new delta bundle of the differences between the
supplied source and target bundle.  The differences are determined by the "tishadow delta" function, which inspects the bundle manifests for file
updates and makes a new bundle of just those files that are updated/new and the target manifest.

In order for "tishadow delta" to be available it must be installed on the box, so to install this simply run:
> sudo npm install -g https://github.com/miniman42/TiShadow/archive/master.tar.gz

Ocassionally this may be updated in which case you will need to uninstall and reinstall, so to uninstall:
> sudo npm uninstall -g tishadow

As a consequence of running "tishadow delta" and how it needs to allocate temporary file storage that apache can access we need to create a TMP directory location
for this purpose and make sure apache has write permissions on same. The script currently assumes this is located at /var/www/tishadow/tmp and that this 
directory is owned by apache. (> chown apache:apache /var/www/tishadow/tmp). This location is export as the TMP env variable when tishadow is executed in
the shell.

Additionally since the process creates delta bundles, it assumes that it can create the delta bundle files and directory structure in a "delta" folder within
the "bundles" root directory. To ensure this is the case apache must be the owner of the "delta" directory. 
(i.e within the bundles dir :> chown apache:apache ./delta ).  

The delta bundles are stored in a similar structure to the bundles themselves except that they are identified by two timestamps in the form:
"./delta/<srctimestamp>_<targetimestamp>/"
 
e.g.
.
.
├── delta
│   └── 1380823513_1380926972
│       └── ios
│           └── carma-splinter.zip
└── delta.php

Note: as these are created via just-in-time access it's possible that a delta will exist for one "os" and not another until it has been requested...

The script uses XFileSend to deliver the bundles efficiently to calling clients (rather than using php output streams...) as such apached mod_xfilesend module
must be installed and available.  Configuration and installation notes for same are available here : 
http://wiki.avego.com/index.php?title=R%26D/Proces/Building_Apache_2.4_and_mod_jk

Once installed it is simply a matter of enabling Xfile send in the bundles/.htaccess file e.g.:
<Files delta.php>
	XSendFile on
</Files>
